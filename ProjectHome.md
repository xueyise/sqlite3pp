### Introduction ###

SQLite3++ is a C++ wrapper of SQLite3 API.

It makes SQLite3 API more friendly to C++ users. It supports almost all of SQLite3 features using C++ classes such as _database_, _command_, _query_, and _transaction_. The _query_ class supports iterator concept for fetching records.

With _ext::function_ class, it's also easy to write the sqlite3's functions and aggregations.
